Dotfiles
=======

Just a collection of dotfiles that I currently use.


Installation
-----------

Clone the repo and move all the files to ~/

Alternatively, grab 
https://github.com/devtea/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/install_dotfiles.sh and run 
it. Naturally, running random scripts off the internet is silly and should 
only be done after heavy drinking and an approprite sacrifice of gold and 
copper traces to the tech gods.

For the lazy and brave:

```bash
    $ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtea/dotfiles/master/bin/install_dotfiles.sh | bash
```
